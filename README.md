# node-varnishstat

A module for node.js that gives you access to Varnish' counters in shared
memory.

A lot of the code is based on varnishstat, and thus has the same license.

Currently only tested on Ubuntu Precise.  Patches that make this module work
on other distributions, without breaking any existing support are very much
welcome.
